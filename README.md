The Deuces Project [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/marktabler/deuces.png)](http://travis-ci.org/koraktor/deuces)
------------------

This is a simple API for a video poker game that handles Deuces Wild, Joker Poker, and a standard 52-card game. One day, I was thinking about how difficult it might be to score a poker hand with wild cards, and when I sat down to puzzle it out it started blossoming into a whole program, so I let it blossom. It felt natural to express the solution as a program, and it felt natural to let the program be a complete entity and not a fragment.

I'm proud of this project because it's polished beyond just the code. The code itself is, I think, concise and efficient while being easy to read and maintain. To that end, I took care to namespace and modularize the project, and provided API documentation for all public methods. Finally, I took the time to learn some new GitHub hooks for CI testing and for Rdoc publication. In short, I'm proud because this isn't a hobbyist's project - it's a journeyman's project.
